# Detecting Tables using Pytorch and Lightning

> **WARNING:** This repository is still a work in progress and things might change drastically.

This repository contains the code for detecting tables in PDF documents by using the PyTorch and the Lightning framework. The following image is just an example of passing a PDF through one of the networks in this repository that is trained on detecting the tables. The red bounding-boxes show the areas in the image that the model has predicted as a table.
