# Setting up repository for evaluation

In order to correctly run the scripts for reproducing the evaluation results, the repository needs two things:

- The latest code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/moeezmalik/Lightning-Table). The repository can be cloned.

- The evaluation data zip file which can be found in [Downloads](../../downloads/index.md) section. Due to its large size, the evaluation data could not be uploaded to GitHub.

Upon extraction of the zip file, a folder will be created with the name 'evaluation-data'. This folder needs to be copied as it is to the root of the cloned repository. The name shall also remain the same. The final folder structure must look as shown in image below.

The setup is now complete in order to run the scripts required to reproduce evaluation results.
